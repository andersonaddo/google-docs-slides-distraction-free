# DistractionFree
The distraction free mode (â–£) for Google Docs and Google Slides hides all controls and buttons and lets you focus on the creation.

This is my own fork of the [original repo](https://github.com/kallepersson/DistractionFree) just so I can release it on Firefox because the original owner wasn't really updating it for Firefox.
